        \n
        \n1.Move to a clear area
        \n2.if you can safely do so; avoid power lines, trees, signs, buildings, vehicles, and other hazards.

    </string>
<string name="EarthQuake_Resistance1">
    <b>Reduce Load</b>
    \n
    \n1.To be earthquake proof, buildings, structures and their foundations need to be built to be resistant to sideways loads.
    \n2.The lighter the building is, the less the loads.
    \n3.This is particularly so when the weight is higher up.
    \n4.Where possible the roof should be of light-weight material.
    \n5.If there are floors and walls and partitions, the lighter these are the better, too.
    </string>
    <string name="EarthQuake_Resistance2">
     <b>Incorporating Base Isolation</b>
        \n
        \n1.As the buildings get bigger and taller other techniques are employed such as \“base isolation.\”
        \n2.During the past 30 years, engineers have constructed skyscrapers that float on systems of ball bearings, springs and padded cylinders.
        \n3.Acting like shock absorbers in a car, these systems allow the building to be decoupled from the shaking of the ground.
    </string>
    <string name="EarthQuake_Resistance3">
    <b>Avoid Reinforced brick or Concrete Block</b>
        \n
        \n1.The most dangerous building construction, from an earthquake point of view, is unreinforced brick or concrete block.
        \n2.Generally, this type of construction has walls that are made of bricks stacked on top of each other and held together with mortar.
        \n3.The roof is laid across the top.
        \n4.The weight of the roof is carried straight down through the wall to the foundation.
        \n5.When this type of construction is subject to a lateral force from an earthquake the walls tip over or crumble and the roof falls in like a house of cards.
